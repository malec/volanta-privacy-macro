# Volanta AutoHotKey Privacy Macro

There are two macros that you can run:
 - [volanta-private.ahk](volanta-private.ahk)
 - [volanta-public.ahk](volanta-public.ahk)

You need to install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to run these macros.
Run the .ahk file and the macro will find volanta window and update the privacy settings using the mouse. There is no key binding set to trigger the macro, just double click an .ahk file and the macro will run. 

This was developed on a screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440. It should be compatible with other displays. 

However, the offsets may need some tweaking over time to click on the correct elements as orbx updates the UI and element positions. Please open an issue here if you have any issues. Also feel free to contribute, as I am a beginner with AutoHotKey and am open to feedback.
